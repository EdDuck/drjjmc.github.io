Hi and welcome! </p>
<p>
This is my permanent place for various
curious, baubles, and gemgaws that I've curated  over the years.
</p>
<p>
As I start making some of this more public this site may be a bit raw, but hopefuly the construction won't prove too frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally I <a href="blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy! You can contact me via <a href="mailto:dr.jjmc@gmail.com">e-mail</a> if you have any questions, concerns, or large checks to deliver.
