Hi and welcome!

This is my relatively new public spot for various curios, baubles, and gewgaws I've been curating over the years.

As I start making more of this public, the website may be a bit raw, but hopefully the construction won't prove too frustrating.  If you spot something amiss or you have a recommendation for the site,
please leave a [suggestion](/suggestions/).

Enjoy!
