Hi and welcome!

My name is John Joseph Carrasco and I'm a permanent member of the Institute for Theoretical Physics ([IPhT](http://ipht.cea.fr)) with a wide range of interests in fundamental physics.

This is my relatively new public spot for various cognitive curios, baubles, and gewgaws I've been curating over the years.

As I start making more of this public, the website may be a bit raw.  If you spot something amiss or you have a recommendation for the site,
please feel free to  leave a [suggestion](/suggestions/).

Enjoy!
