Hi and welcome!

This is my public place for various curious, baubles, and gewgaws I've been curating over the years. Many involve *code*, and *thought*, and science that's been facilitated, often but not always, with code and thought.

As I start making some of this more public, the website may be a bit raw, but hopefully the construction won't prove too frustrating.
