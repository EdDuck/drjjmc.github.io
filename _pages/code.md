I'll update here with links to code I've contributed to/developed.

## Related to the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure:

* *CosmoEFT:* Calculating 1 & 2-loop IR-safe power spectra for realistic cosmologies.  c++.

    * Uses Copter to map from transfer function/cosmology to linear powerspectrum & CUBA monte carlo library for integration. Hosted [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~senatore/CosmoEFT.tar.gz).

    * Originally developed in a project with Daniel Green, Simon Forman, and Leonardo Senatore towards precision EFTofLSS predictions at two-loops. Updated later to expand around Planck Best-fit Cosmology by M. Cataneo and S. Forman. Currently maintained by M. Cataneo.

* See also other useful EFT code Leonardo has curated: [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~senatore/), esp towards resumming in the IR.

* If theres interest, I can polish and upload some rough and ready Mathematica code for EFT of LSS at 1-loop including exact time evolution.

## Related to scattering amplitudes, unitarity, and double-copy.

* **ampGraphTools:** Mathematica library for graph manipulation/dressing etc.  Hosted [here](http://drjjmc.github.io/ampGraphTools_mma).
