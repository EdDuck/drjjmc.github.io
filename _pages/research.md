## Big Questions:
  * What unifies our physical predictions?
  * How does the relatively calm macroscopic universe survive and emerge from the violent quantum fluctuations of its underlying microphysics?
  * How do classical notions of space and time emerge from fundamental principles, and what governs their evolution?
  * How are should our classical understanding of space and time be modified to build intuition of underlying quantum reality?
  * How might our current understanding of quantum mechanics need to evolve to resolve answers to the above questions?

## Broad projects:
  * Double copy unification of relativistic quantum field theories.
  * Double copy relevance for classical predictions in perturbative gravity.
  * Predictivity question re: pointlike quantum field theories of gravity. (Are all QFT of gravity *effective* out of necessity?)
  * Relevance of field-theory double-copy to ultra-soft properties of string theory.  (See Z-theory.)
  * Effective field theory of large scale structure (EFTofLSS)
  * $$\alpha$$-Attractor Inflationary models.

## Research highlights:
  * Discovered the color-kinematic duality in gauge theories and the associated double-copy structure of tree and multi-loop gravity theory amplitudes.  Importance: Striking clarification of the intimacy between gauge and gravity theories, redundancy present in both,  changing the way we calculate in and think about these theories. (For a textbook introduction can now see Anthony Zee's Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell,  2nd Ed., Chapter N.4.  For popular science account see May 2012 cover story of Scientific American.)  \\

  * Discovered the $$(n-3)!$$ basis (``BCJ'' basis) of gauge-theory tree-level amplitudes.   Importance: Led to proofs of explicit tree-level gauge-gravity amplitude-level relations (KLT) in field theory, subsequent discovery of analogous structure in string theory led to closed form string-KLT expressions and all-order expressions for tree-amplitudes in string theory. \\

  * Established the predictive impact of certain anomalies relevant to $${\cal N}\le4$$ supergravity theories, and perhaps more strikingly their underlying double-copy origins.  Importance: There is mounting evidence to suggest that failure of predictivity for pure supergravity theories in four-dimensions are directly related to these anomalies, which * do not exist* for $${\cal N}>5$$ supergravity theories.\\

 * Established the effective field theory of cosmological large-scale structure. Importance:  opens up a rigorous new way to analytically study  large-scale structure taking into account the nonlinearity of small-scale perturbations with telling agreement between numerical simulations and analytic theory.\\
<sub>with: Foreman, Green, Hertzberg, Senatore.</sub>
* Discovered a systematic, theory-independent, approach to unitarity-based multi-loop perturbative quantization - Method of Maximal Cuts.  Importance: Establishes hierarchy of relevance of $$S$$-matrix information for a given theory.  Explicit demonstration of unexpectedly good UV behavior of maximally supersymmetric supergravity. Trivialized unitarity state-sums for theories whose spectra are truncations of $${\cal N}=4$$ super Yang-Mills[^footnote] in 4D to just tracking glue around MHV-vertex graphs.\\
<sub>with: Bern, Dixon, Kosower, Roiban, Johansson.</sub>
* Established covariant prescriptions for deforming non-linear duality-invariant theories.  Importance: demonstration of freedom to introduce counterterms to theories protected by duality-invariance, may be relevant to UV questions in gravity.\\
<sub>with: Broedel, Ferrara, Kallosh, Roiban</sub>
* Established Z-theory as the effective bi-colored scalar theory which encodes all the $$\alpha'$$ corrections of the open-string, and thus encodes all the ultra-soft UV behavior.\\
<sub> with: Mafra and Schlotterer</sub>

[^footnote]: So, also, theories that are orbifolds of $${\cal N}=8$$ supergravity.
