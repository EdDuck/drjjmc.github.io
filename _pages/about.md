John Joseph Murphy Carrasco is a tenured theoretical physicist and cosmologist who has been at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics (IPhT)](http://ipht.cea.fr/en/), [CEA-Saclay](http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en) and [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) since July 2015.

This means he gets to ask questions for a living.

The cosmology bit means he sometimes asks big questions about the beginning of the universe, and how it got to be the way it is now, and where it might be going.  The theoretical physicist bit means the questions themselves have to make sense; they should fit into some sort of framework through which we hope to apprehend the rules of the universe in general.

In fact, as a [Declarative Theoretical Physicist](http://fancyphysics.org), he strives to allow the art of achieving the *what* in his predictions to dictate the stories of the *how*. Towards this end he studies and looks for new structures in the scattering amplitudes of relativistic quantum field theories.

He joined IPhT and moved to Europe as an awardee of the 2014 call for European Research Commission Starting Grants, for the project *Strategic Predictions for Quantum Field Theories*.  Prior to IPhT, he was a Member of the [Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.ias.edu) in Princeton,NJ and held a postdoctoral position at the [Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://sitp.stanford.edu). Dr. Carrasco received his doctorate at [UCLA](http://www.pa.ucla.edu) in 2010, after earning his undergraduate degree from [Caltech](http://pma.caltech.edu) in 2005.

Before graduating from Caltech, he worked as a programmer at [Jobtrak Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOBTRAK), then as a software and research engineer at [Goto.com/Overture.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing) where he was responsible for data insight, search serving optimization, winning two patents, and eventually helping begin Overture Research Labs (eventually [Yahoo! Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing)). These experiences have allowed Dr. Carrasco a singular perspective (within the academy!) on the semi-permeable membrane between industry and academia. He strongly feels it is in the best interests of both
for this model to be more of a revolving door then the mostly one-way passage it often currently is.  Indeed if you are not in academia, but you think you have skills that could
be useful to fundamental research, please feel free to [get in contact](mailto:dr.jjmc@gmail.com).

He currently lives with [Liz](https://twitter.com/deneiges) and their four children on ÃŽle Saint Louis, in central Paris.

When not thinking/doing/teaching/sharing science for fun and profit, he runs, skates, plays (with) his violin, and cooks, whilst continuously parenting and spousing.
