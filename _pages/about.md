## Bio

I'm a theoretical physicist and occasional cosmologist at [Northwestern University](https://www.physics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core-faculty/), formerly at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics (IPhT)](http://ipht.cea.fr/en/), [CEA-Saclay](http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en) and [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en).

This means I get to ask questions for a living.

The cosmology bit means I sometimes ask big questions about the beginning of the universe, and how it got to be the way it is now, and where it might be going.  The theoretical physicist bit means the questions themselves have to make sense; they should fit into some sort of framework through which we hope to apprehend the rules of the universe in general.

In fact, as a [Declarative Theoretical Physicist](http://fancyphysics.org), I strive to allow the art of achieving the *what* in my predictions to dictate the stories of the *how*. Towards this end I study and looks for new structures in the scattering amplitudes of relativistic quantum field theories.

I joined the faculty of Northwestern University in 2018.  I've been a Member of the [Institute for Advanced Study](http://www.ias.edu) in Princeton,NJ and held a postdoctoral position at the [Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://sitp.stanford.edu). I received my doctorate at [UCLA](http://www.pa.ucla.edu) in 2010, after earning my undergraduate degree from [Caltech](http://pma.caltech.edu) in 2005.

Before graduating from Caltech, I worked as a programmer at [Jobtrak Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOBTRAK), then as a software and research engineer/scientist at [Goto.com/Overture.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing) where I was responsible for data insight, search serving optimization, establishing two patents, and helping begin Overture Research Labs (eventually [Yahoo! Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search_Marketing)).

Having been one of the unfortunately few beneficiaries of successfully transitioning from industry into research-driven academia, I've developed some opinions.  For the most part, theoretical physics and industry are separated by a semi-permeable membrane flowing from academia to business. I strongly feel it is in the best interests of both for there to be **much** more bi-directional cross-over.  Indeed if you are not in academia, but you have interest in contributing to fundamental research, please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:jjmc@prettyquestions.com).

I currently live with [Liz](https://twitter.com/deneiges) and our four children in a momentum eigenstate.

When not thinking/doing/coding/teaching/sharing science for fun and profit, I run, skate, play (with) my violin, and cook, whilst continuously parenting and spousing.
