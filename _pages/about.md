excerpt: ABOUT THE AUTHOR
---


John Joseph Murphy Carrasco is a tenured theoretical physicist and cosmologist who has been at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, CEA-Saclay and University Paris-Saclay since July 2015.
This means he gets to ask questions for a living.

The Cosmologist bit means he gets to ask big questions about the beginning of the universe, and how it got to be the way it is now, and where it might be going.  The theoretical physicist bit means the questions themselves have to make sense consistently when considered from the natural language of various scales.  He's not just a theoretical physicist, but he's a [Declarative Theoretical Physicist](http://fancyphysics.org) -- which means he strives to have his stories constrained only by the *what* of their predictions, allowing the *how* to be just as surprising as we expect it to be (if not more so!).

Prior to IPhT, he got his BS at Caltech, his MS and PhD at UCLA, held a postdoctoral position at Stanford, and was a Member of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, NJ.

Before graduating from Caltech, he worked as a programmer at Jobtrak Corporation, and as an software engineer at Goto.com/Overture.com where he was responsible for data insight, search serving optimization, and eventually co-founded Overture Research Labs with Dan Fain.

Prior to all that he lived in Wilmington, NC and Johnson City, TN and Eugene, OR and Delmar, NY, having had the good fortune to be born in Brooklyn's Maimonides Hospital.
