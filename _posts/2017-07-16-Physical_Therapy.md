So April 26, 2017, I managed to fracture my left leg in multiple places after taking the right skateboard down the wrong hill.

External hardware was removed a few weeks ago (day before I went to Israel for Strings 2017).

My grandfather Vincent Carrasco (who just turned 100 yesterday!!) has been working with a physical therapist, Bradford Matalon. Mr. Matalon took a look at my x-rays when my folks were visiting Long Island, and had some exercise suggestions, which he  generously agreed to let me share.
